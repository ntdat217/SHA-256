## Introduction

Cryptographic algorithms are essential for ensuring data security in the digital age. Among these algorithms, SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) stands out as a widely used cryptographic hash function. Developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as part of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, SHA-256 provides a high level of security, making it a cornerstone in many cryptographic protocols and applications.

SHA-256 is utilized in various critical applications such as digital signatures, certificate generation, and blockchain technology. For instance, the Bitcoin blockchain relies on SHA-256 for mining and transaction verification, underlining its importance in securing decentralized financial systems. Despite its robustness, implementing SHA-256 in software can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in resource-constrained environments or applications requiring real-time processing.

This thesis addresses the challenge of implementing the SHA-256 algorithm as a dedicated hardware module, focusing on designing and optimizing a specialized chip. By transitioning from software-based implementations to hardware, significant improvements in speed, efficiency, and power consumption can be achieved. The dedicated hardware approach is particularly beneficial for applications in mobile devices, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, and high-frequency trading systems, where processing speed and energy efficiency are paramount.

The motivation for this research stems from the growing demand for secure and efficient cryptographic solutions in modern technology. As data breaches and cyber-attacks become more sophisticated, the need for robust security mechanisms intensifies. By developing a specialized chip for SHA-256, we aim to provide a solution that not only meets security requirements but also enhances performance and energy efficiency, thereby broadening the applicability of SHA-256.
